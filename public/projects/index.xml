      <description>Inspired by the ideal consistency of pasta — &amp;ldquo;to the tooth&amp;rdquo; — this mighty restaurant finder makes it easier than ever to find the restaurant that&amp;rsquo;s perfect for you. Simply type in a search term, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find results curated by Yelp&amp;rsquo;s search engine. If you&amp;rsquo;re paralyzed by indecision, use the convenient Quick Recommendations panel for ideas. With automated location access, you can skip the hassle of typing in your location.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a college student trying to grab an appointment for a behind-the-wheel test. Unfortunately, appointments are literally booked out three months in advance. There are occasional openings when someone cancels, but these are hard to find and usually snatched up instantly. I went looking for bots online to automate this appointment search for me, but none of them work ever since the DMV deployed a ReCaptcha on the appointment finder page.</description>
