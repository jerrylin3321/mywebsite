Sensitive documents obtained by _The Maroon_ last summer and a new lawsuit reveal a strained relationship between the University of Chicago and the Pearson family, calling the future of the Pearson Institute, which was supposed to change the world, into question.

**Notes:** I broke this story, catching Chicago media outlets by surprise, possibly because the lawsuit was filed in a district court in Oklahoma—not in Illinois. The article was [cited](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pearson-family-sues-university-of-chicago-over-100-million-gift-1520364102) on Page A2 of _The Wall Street Journal._ The _[Chicago Sun-Times](https://twitter.com/Suntimes/status/970902064913055744)_ and the _Chicago Tribune_ ran their own reporting on the story on their respective front pages.

I was later subpoenaed by the Pearson family for documents used to produce this article; the subpoena made national [headlines](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/25/media/euirim-choi-university-of-chicago-pearsons/index.html).

The article is the most-read _Maroon_ article in the past two years. The Illinois Collegiate Press Association said that this was 2018’s **best news story in Illinois** at the university level. The article won in the large school (4,000+ students) non-dailies category.
