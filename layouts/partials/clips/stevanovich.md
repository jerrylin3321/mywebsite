Documents reveal that UChicago trustee Steve Stevanovich is late on over \$12 million in pledges to the University, and that by overselling his aviation company he may have committed securities fraud.

**Notes:** Our investigation was [profiled](https://www.axios.com/university-of-chicago-steve-stevanovich-billionaire-ee450f89-1b4a-4d09-b281-5badac0682aa.html) by Felix Salmon from _Axios,_ who called it “fantastic.” Our article was [cited](https://twitter.com/euirim/status/1041015878870028293) in federal bankruptcy court.

The almost 5,000-word investigative piece required reading over 1,000 pages of documents. I also coded a special site to host the article and designed the featured graphic.
