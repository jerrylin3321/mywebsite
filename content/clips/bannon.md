Booth professor Luigi Zingales, who is interested in populism, confirmed to *The Maroon* that Bannon accepted his invitation.

**Note:** I waited for two hours outside Professor Zingalesâ€™ office to confirm a tip that we received. We then published a story before every outlet, which would later be confirmed by the *Chicago Sun-Times* and the *Chicago Tribune.* *The Washington Post* wrote about the invitation as well.
