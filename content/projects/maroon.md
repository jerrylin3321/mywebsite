Every year millions of people around the world read *The Chicago Maroon's* journalism online. I rebuilt the website from the ground up using Django as well as JavaScript and moved the site from being hosted locally to being supported by Amazon AWS.

*The Maroon* received an award from the Illinois College Press Association for being the best university newspaper website in Illinois in 2018. It won in the large school (4,000+ students) non-dailies category.
