Navigation apps like Waze claim to "outsmart traffic and get everyone the best route." But what happens when everyone's using these apps at the same time? In all kinds of cities across America, navigation apps have sent hordes of drivers down local streets not meant for such levels of traffic, endangering residents and increasing congestion.

In this paper, I attempt to empirically confirm this affect of app-induced congestion on local streets by analyzing data and quantifying the increase in travel times on local streets due to cut-through traffic. We determine that navigation apps have a statistically significant effect in increasing congestion on local streets, while modestly impacting travel times. Our results are a call to action for transportation engineers and planners to develop strategies to combat app-induced congestion; key improvements can be made in collaboration with navigation app companies, and encouraging competing app companies to share data.
