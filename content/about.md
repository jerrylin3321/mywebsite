I'm a Master's student at Stanford in computer science working in the [Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu). I'm interested in cybersecurity, evolutionary computation, complex adaptive systems, online abuse, natural language processing, YouTube, and journalism.

While in college at the University of Chicago, I was the Editor-in-Chief of *The Chicago Maroon* from 2018 to 2019, where I broke news that received national attention and built [Marketplace](https://marketplace.chicagomaroon.com/), a buy-sell platform used by over 10,000 people in Chicago's Hyde Park and beyond.

In school, I researched how changes to websites' JavaScript can be tracked over time with [Ariel Feldman](http://arifeldman.com/) and published a research paper on how awareness of tracking for online behavioral advertising may change users' web browsing behavior with [Blase Ur](https://blaseur.com). I was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society my junior year.

I've previously worked as a Security Engineer Intern at Facebook, where I worked to protect 2.2+ billion people from the most dangerous threats on the platform. I've also tutored struggling students in computer science.
